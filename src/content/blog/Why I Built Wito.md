## Why I Built Wito: A Fast, Flexible Framework for Linux Prototyping

Wito grew out of my need for a fast, flexible framework to experiment and prototype Linux desktop applications. I’d previously used Qt, but its restrictive licensing pushed me to explore alternatives. GTK proved to be the perfect fit—open, adaptable, and, importantly, more permissive.

Wito combines the flexibility of web technologies with the performance of native applications. By embedding WebKit and integrating Python, Wito lets me (and hopefully others) build modern interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while still handling complex tasks with Python. This setup is incredibly powerful for quickly spinning up new ideas without getting bogged down in complex configurations or licensing concerns.

For anyone looking to experiment on Linux and build robust prototypes without sacrificing speed or design flexibility, Wito might be just the tool to try.
